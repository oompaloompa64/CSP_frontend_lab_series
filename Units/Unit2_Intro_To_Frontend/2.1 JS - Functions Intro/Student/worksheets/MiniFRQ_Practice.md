# 2.1 Functions Intro – Worksheet
## Mini FRQ – sum() and avg()

You will design two functions that work together: `sum(array)` and `avg(array)`.

---

### Part 1 – Pseudocode

Write pseudocode for each function.

1. `sum(array)`



2. `avg(array)`



---

### Part 2 – Edge Cases

What should each function do if the array is **empty**? Explain in one or two sentences.



---

### Part 3 – Test Cases

Design at least **3 test cases** for each function.

Example for `sum`:

- Input: `[1, 2, 3]` → Output: `6`

Fill in your own below.
