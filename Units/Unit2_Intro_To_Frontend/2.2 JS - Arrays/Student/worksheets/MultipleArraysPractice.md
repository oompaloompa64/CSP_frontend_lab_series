# 2.2 JS Arrays – Worksheet
## Multiple Arrays Practice

---

### Part A – Declare Arrays

Write code (no need to run) to declare the following arrays:

1. An empty array named `scores`.
2. An array named `colors` with at least 3 color strings.
3. An array named `mixed` with a string, a number and a boolean.

---

### Part B – Access by Index

Using your `colors` array from Part A:

4. Write a line of code to log the **first** color.
5. Write a line of code to log the **last** color using `.length - 1`.

---

### Part C – Add and Remove

6. Using `scores`, write code that:

- adds `10` to the end
- adds `5` to the beginning
- removes the last element

7. Using `colors`, write code that removes **1 element at index 1** using `splice`.

---

### Part D – Loops

8. Write a `for` loop that logs each element of `colors`.

9. Write a `forEach` call that logs each element of `colors`.
