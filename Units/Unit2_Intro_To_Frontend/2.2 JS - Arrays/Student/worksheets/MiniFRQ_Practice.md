# 2.2 JS Arrays – Worksheet
## Mini FRQ – Array Methods and Iteration

You will design a small set of helper functions that work with arrays.

---

### Part 1 – Requirements

Write pseudocode for a function called `summarizeNames(namesArray)` that:

- prints how many names are in the array
- prints each name with its index (e.g. `0: Pedro`)
- returns the total number of names

---

### Part 2 – Edge Case

How should `summarizeNames` behave if `namesArray` is empty?  
Write your answer in 1–2 sentences.



---

### Part 3 – Test Cases

Design at least **3 test inputs** for `summarizeNames(namesArray)` and what you expect to see logged / returned.

Example:

- Input: `["Ana"]` → logs `1` name, `0: Ana`, returns `1`
